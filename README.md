Credit Management Website : 


A simple dynamic website that is used to manage transfer of credits between multiple users by using simple web designing technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL.
( Credit is sort of points which can be transferred from one user to another. )
Each user having its own id and name , is supposed to select their name from the table in 2.php to view their previous transactions and to transfer money to other users in next.php .
Then sender then fills appropriate details of the receiver and the amount(credits) to be transferred in next.php .
The transaction is successfull if it satisfies all the contraints like : a sender cannot transfer money to itself, the receiver should be present in the users table ( given in 2.php) and the minimum balance in senders account should be 100.
If constraints are not satisfied then the transaction fails.
In either case, user will be directed to 2.php .
If the transaction is successful then all the corresponding details are successfully updated in 2.php .

Any suggestions will be happily welcomed.
